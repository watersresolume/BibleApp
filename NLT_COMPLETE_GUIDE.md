- **For speed**: Use Option 3 (Pre-made data)
- **For learning**: Use Option 2 (Automated)

### Step 2: Format the Data
Each book should follow this structure:

```javascript
'Genesis': {
    1: {
        1: 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.',
        2: 'The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters...',
        // ... continue for all verses
    },
    2: {
        1: 'So the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything in them was completed.',
        // ... continue for all verses
    },
    // ... continue for all 50 chapters
}
```

### Step 3: Add to nlt-data.js
Replace the placeholder structure with actual NLT text:

```javascript
export const nltData = {
    'Genesis': {
        1: {
            1: 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.',
            2: 'The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters...',
            // ... all verses
        },
