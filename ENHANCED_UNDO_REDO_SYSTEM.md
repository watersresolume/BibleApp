# Enhanced Undo/Redo System

## Overview

The Bible app now features a comprehensive undo/redo system that tracks **ALL** user actions, not just drawing operations. This system provides a complete history of user interactions and allows for full state restoration.

## Features

### ✅ Tracked Actions

1. **Drawing Actions** - All pen, highlighter, and eraser strokes
2. **Clear Actions** - Both tab-specific and app-wide clearing operations
3. **Tool Changes** - Switching between pen, highlighter, and eraser tools
4. **Color Changes** - Changing pen and highlighter colors
5. **Size Changes** - Adjusting pen size via slider

### ✅ User Interface

- **Visual Feedback** - Buttons show enabled/disabled states clearly
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Standard Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y support
- **Tooltips** - Show keyboard shortcuts on hover
- **Responsive Design** - Buttons adapt to different screen sizes

### ✅ Technical Implementation

- **Action-Based System** - Each action is tracked with metadata
- **Canvas State Capture** - Full canvas state saved for drawing/clear actions
- **State Restoration** - Complete restoration of previous states
- **Memory Management** - Limited history size (50 actions per passage)
- **Cross-Tab Support** - Each passage maintains its own history

## Implementation Details

### Action Types

```javascript
const ACTION_TYPES = {
  DRAW: 'draw',           // Drawing strokes
  CLEAR: 'clear',         // Clear operations
  TOOL_CHANGE: 'tool_change',     // Tool switching
  COLOR_CHANGE: 'color_change',   // Color changes
  SIZE_CHANGE: 'size_change',     // Size adjustments
  LOAD_PASSAGE: 'load_passage'    // Passage loading
};
```

### Action Structure

Each action contains:
- `type` - The action type
- `timestamp` - When the action occurred
- `tabId` - Which tab the action occurred in
- `passageKey` - Which passage the action affects
- `data` - Action-specific data (e.g., from/to values)
- `canvasState` - Canvas state for drawing/clear actions

### Key Functions

#### `createAction(type, data)`
Creates a new action with current state capture.

#### `pushAction(action)`
Adds an action to the history and clears the redo stack.

#### `undoAction()`
Restores the previous state based on action type.

#### `redoAction()`
Reapplies an undone action.

## Usage

### Mouse/Touch
- Click the undo/redo buttons in the toolbar
- Buttons are disabled when no actions are available

### Keyboard
- `Ctrl+Z` - Undo last action
- `Ctrl+Y` - Redo last undone action
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` - Alternative redo shortcut

### Clear Operations
- **Tap** clear button - Clear current tab (undoable)
- **Hold** clear button (500ms) - Clear entire app (undoable)

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Complete State Tracking
Unlike the previous system that only tracked drawing, this system captures all user interactions.

### 2. Proper State Restoration
Each action type has specific restoration logic:
- Drawing/Clear: Restore canvas state
- Tool changes: Restore previous tool
- Color changes: Restore previous color
- Size changes: Restore previous size

### 3. Memory Efficient
- Limited to 50 actions per passage
- Automatic cleanup of old actions
- Separate history per passage

### 4. User Experience
- Immediate visual feedback
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- Clear button states
- Tooltips for guidance

## Testing

Use `test-enhanced-undo-redo.html` to test all functionality:

1. Load a Bible passage
2. Draw with different tools and colors
3. Change tools, colors, and pen size
4. Use undo/redo buttons or keyboard shortcuts
5. Test clearing operations
6. Verify all actions can be undone/redone

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility:
- Legacy `pushHistory()`, `undoAnnotation()`, `redoAnnotation()` functions still work
- They now use the new action system internally
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Undo/redo for passage loading
- Undo/redo for tab operations
- Visual history timeline
- Action grouping for complex operations
- Export/import of action history

## Files Modified

- `app.js` - Main implementation
- `styles.css` - Enhanced button styles
- `index.html` - Added keyboard shortcut hints
- `test-enhanced-undo-redo.html` - Test file
- `ENHANCED_UNDO_REDO_SYSTEM.md` - This documentation

## Conclusion

The enhanced undo/redo system provides a complete, professional-grade undo/redo experience that tracks all user actions and provides multiple ways to interact with the history. The implementation is robust, memory-efficient, and maintains full backward compatibility.
