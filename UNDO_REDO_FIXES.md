# Undo/Redo System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tab Restoration Not Loading Text
**Problem**: When undoing a closed tab, the tab would be restored but the text content wouldn't load, requiring the user to manually click the "Fire" button.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `restoreTab` method to properly restore tab content:
- Added logic to check if the tab was loaded with passage data
- If saved text exists, restore it directly
- If no saved text, automatically reload the passage
- Ensures the tab is fully functional after restoration

### 2. Eraser Actions Not Being Undone
**Problem**: Eraser actions were being treated as regular DRAW actions, causing them to not be properly tracked and undone.

**Solution**: 
- Added `ERASE` to the `ACTION_TYPES` enum
- Modified `endDrawing` function to differentiate between DRAW and ERASE actions
- Updated `captureStateBeforeAction` to handle ERASE actions
- Updated undo/redo handlers to treat ERASE the same as DRAW

### 3. Pen Annotations Moving Instead of Being Removed
**Problem**: The undo system was restoring full canvas states, which could cause all annotations to move or behave unexpectedly.

**Solution**: 
- Improved state capture to store the exact canvas state before each action
- Enhanced state restoration to properly restore the previous state
- Ensured that only the last action is undone, not all annotations

### 4. Highlighter Annotations Not Being Undone
**Problem**: Same issue as pen annotations - highlighter strokes weren't being properly undone.

**Solution**: 
- Applied the same state-based approach used for pen annotations
- Highlighter actions now properly capture and restore canvas states
- Each highlighter stroke can be individually undone

### 5. Pen Size Tool Priority Issues
**Problem**: The pen tool was showing the color dropdown when clicked, making it difficult to access the size slider.

**Solution**:
- Changed pen button behavior: click shows size slider, right-click shows color picker
- Reduced hold time from 350ms to 200ms for better responsiveness
- Added direct click access to the size slider popup
- Made the size slider easier to access and use

## Technical Implementation

### Action Types
```javascript
const ACTION_TYPES = {
  DRAW: 'draw',
  ERASE: 'erase',  // NEW
  CLEAR: 'clear',
  TOOL_CHANGE: 'tool_change',
  COLOR_CHANGE: 'color_change',
  SIZE_CHANGE: 'size_change',
  TAB_CREATE: 'tab_create',
  TAB_CLOSE: 'tab_close',
  TAB_SWITCH: 'tab_switch',
  PASSAGE_LOAD: 'passage_load'
};
```

### Enhanced Tab Restoration
```javascript
restoreTab(tabData, makeActive = false) {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // If the tab was loaded, restore the content
    if (restoredTab.loaded && restoredTab.book && restoredTab.chapter && restoredTab.verse) {
        if (restoredTab.savedText) {
            this.restoreTabContent(restoredTab);
        } else {
            this.loadPassage(restoredTab.id);
        }
    }
}
```

### Improved Pen Tool UI
```javascript
// Click shows size slider
penBtn.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    if (currentTool === 'pen') {
        showPenSizeSlider();
        penColorDropdown.classList.remove('show');
    }
    // ... rest of logic
});

// Right-click shows color picker
penBtn.addEventListener('contextmenu', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (currentTool === 'pen') {
        penColorDropdown.classList.toggle('show');
        penSizeSliderPopup.classList.remove('show');
    }
});
```

## Testing

Use the `test-undo-fixes.html` file to verify all fixes:

1. **Tab Operations**: Create/close tabs and verify undo/redo works with text restoration
2. **Drawing Tools**: Test pen, highlighter, and eraser undo/redo
3. **Pen Size Tool**: Verify size slider priority and ease of use
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Test Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y functionality

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Users can now undo any action without unexpected behavior
- **Improved Workflow**: Pen size tool is easier to access and use
- **Reliable State Management**: All user actions are properly tracked and can be undone
- **Consistent Behavior**: All drawing tools (pen, highlighter, eraser) work consistently with undo/redo

## Backward Compatibility

All fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing annotations and user data. The enhanced undo/redo system works alongside the existing annotation persistence system.
